HURTZ-LOCKER

## Description

Introducing HertzLocker, the Inventory Management System that composes a new melody for how you handle and monitor your inventory. Engineered with Node.js and Express.js, HertzLocker combines a robust backend with an intuitive front end, creating a seamless user experience that's as harmonious as a well-orchestrated musical piece.

A User can organize multiple Gigs, creating a one-to-many relationship (User to Gigs).
Each Gig can have multiple InventoryItems associated with it, forming a one-to-many relationship (Gig to InventoryItems).
